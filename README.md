othello
=======

This repository contains Othello game program implemented in various languages. Othello makes for an ideal material for leaning a new language since it encompasses the basic building blocks of a program - things such as function definitions, array and string manipulation, control statements and basic IO.

Feel free to contribute improvements or even better, implementation in new languages!
